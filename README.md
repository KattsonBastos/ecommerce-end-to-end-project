# End-to-End Ecommerce Practical Project: from database designing to a churn prediction model deployment

<p align="justify">
Hi!! :raising_hand_man:
<br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This repo is in construction phase and it'll be place for an end-to-end project relate to retail data pipelines and ML modeling. In sum, the project will contain five major steps:
</p>

- **2)** Business problem description (actually, it's just some business problem I'm going to create base on the dataset info)
- **2)** Relational database design and data migration (actually, we'll just model the database and load data into it from a public dataset)
- **3)** ETL pipeline: from the relational database to a BigQuery dataset's table
- **4)** Churn Prediction modeling and model deployment.
- **5)** Data workflow for model predictions

<p align="justify">
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For all of this, we'll use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download">well-known Olist dataset from Kaglle</a> as our data source.
</p>

## Project Steps:
- :black_square_button: The business problem
- :black_square_button: Database design
    - :black_square_button: Design the database schema
    - :black_square_button: Load raw data into the database

- :black_square_button: ETL pipeline
    - :black_square_button: Extract data from the source
    - :black_square_button: Make data transformations
    - :black_square_button: Load data into a Bigquery table

- :black_square_button: ML modeling
    - :black_square_button: Data loading
    - :black_square_button: Data preparation
    - :black_square_button: Model training
    - :black_square_button: Model Deployment
    - :black_square_button: Model Monitoring
- :black_square_button: Data workflow for model predictions

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Since this practice project is in development, the above steps and sub steps could change, such the addition of raw/refined tables in the ETL steps and so on.
